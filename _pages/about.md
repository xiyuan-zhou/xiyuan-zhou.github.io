Hello! I am Xiyuan Zhou, and I started my PhD in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in August 2024. I graduated with First Class Honors in May 2024 from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ), where I majored in Financial Engineering - FinTech and minored in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics.

I have been supervised by Prof. [Prof. Junhua Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M2oDRWEAAAAJ&hl=en) (CUHKSZ) since my freshman year, starting from my undergraduate studies and continuing into my PhD research. I am currently pursuing my PhD at NTU, under the supervision of [Prof. Yan Xu](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=ZAhePQ4AAAAJ&hl=en). I sincerely appreciate the mentorship of [Prof. Bohui Zhang](https://sites.google.com/site/bohuizhang/) (CUHKSZ) during my undergraduate years. My research focuses on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), especially their real-world applications. Feel free to reach out via email if you're interested in my work!
