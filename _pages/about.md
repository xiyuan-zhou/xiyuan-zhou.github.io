I am a senior undergraduate student at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/), majoring in [Financial Engineering - FinTech](https://sme.cuhk.edu.cn/en/page/72) and minoring in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. I am on track to complete my degree in 2024. During my academic journey, I have been consistently recognized with Dean's List honors and have received the Undergraduate Research Assistant Award for my contributions to research.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Junhua Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M2oDRWEAAAAJ&hl=en) of Energy Internet Lab from [School of Science and Engineering](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en), The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. Under his mentorship, I have gained valuable insights and guidance in pursuing my research works.
