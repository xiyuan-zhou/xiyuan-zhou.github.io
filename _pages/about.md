In August 2024, I enrolled at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore to pursue a Doctorate in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. I hold a Bachelor’s degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, majoring in Financial Engineering - FinTech, with a minor in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics.

I am profoundly honored to have been conducting my research under the guidance of [Prof. Junhua Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M2oDRWEAAAAJ&hl=en) since my freshman year.  His invaluable guidance and deep insights are pivotal to my academic journey and growth. Simultaneously, I am deeply grateful to [Prof. Bohui Zhang](https://sites.google.com/site/bohuizhang/), who serves as my supervisor and academic advisor, providing essential guidance and advice that significantly contributes to the depth of my research. I wish to express my utmost respect and gratitude to both professors for their influential roles.


2024年8月，我进入新加坡南洋理工大学攻读电子电气工程博士学位。本科毕业于香港中文大学（深圳），主修金融工程-金融科技，辅修数学与应用数学。

我深感荣幸能够从大一开始，就在[赵俊华教授](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M2oDRWEAAAAJ&hl=en)的主导下进行我的研究，他的宝贵指导和深刻洞察对我的学术旅程和成长至关重要。同时，我也深深感激[张博辉教授](https://sites.google.com/site/bohuizhang/)，他作为我的导师和学术顾问，提供了至关重要的指导和建议，这些对我的研究和学习有着巨大帮助。两位教授是我本科阶段最重要的导师，也是我学术旅程的引路人。
