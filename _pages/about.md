I am a senior undergraduate student at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/), majoring in [Financial Engineering - FinTech](https://sme.cuhk.edu.cn/en/page/72) and minoring in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics (not yet declare). I am on track to complete my degree in 2024.

Under his mentorship, I have gained valuable insights and guidance in pursuing my research works.
